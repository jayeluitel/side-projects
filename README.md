# side-projects
 Small programs and side projects that I work on during my free time.


AzureADAudit:
 A program that I created for work. It uses Graph API to get all users and user security groups in Azure Active Directory.

FTPAutomation:
 Another program for work. Uses WinSCP to access files hosted on a remote server, downloads the file locally, and accesses an API endpoint to upload the file.

RandomPasswordGenerator:
 Written in Python3, mainly use it to generate new passwords for myself with whatever requirements each website needs.
 
WebScraper
 Also written in Python3, followed a tutorial to get familiar with the language.
